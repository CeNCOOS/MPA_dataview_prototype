  This data file represents a time series of canopy biomass of the giant
  kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, derived from Landsat
  5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
  (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery,
  along with relevant metadata. The kelp canopy is composed of the
  portions of fronds floating on the surface of the water. Biomass data
  (wet weight, kg) are given for individual 30 x 30 meter pixels in the
  coastal areas extending from near Año Nuevo to San Diego, CA,
  including the Northern and Southern Channel Islands.

      
  Data were derived from the three Landsat sensors listed above.
  Observations are made on a 16 day repeat cycle, for each instrument,
  but the temporal coverage is irregular because of cloud cover,
  instrument failure, and the mission length of each sensor (TM: 1984 –
  2011, ETM+: 1999 – present, OLI: 2013 – present). Estimates of kelp
  canopy biomass are derived from the relationship between satellite
  surface reflectance and empirical measurements of kelp canopy biomass
  in long-term SBC LTER study plots obtained using SCUBA. The different
  Landsat sensors were calibrated to each other using simulated Landsat
  data derived from hyperspectral imagery. Missing data due to the ETM+
  scan line corrector error were filled using a synchrony-based gap
  filling method.

      
  Data are organized into a single NetCDF file and contain the quarterly
  means for each Landsat pixel across the three sensors. Relevant
  metadata such as number of Landsat estimates from which the mean was
  derived, the number of estimates from each sensor, standard error for
  each quarterly estimate, spatial coordinates, and date are all
  included in the file. For assistance with the data, please contact
  sbclter@msi.ucsb.edu.

          The primary research objective of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER is to investigate
            the importance of land and ocean processes in structuring giant kelp
            (Macrocystis pyrifera ) forest ecosystems. As in many temperate
            regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated
            by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are
            influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open
            ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and
            processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and
            pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs.
            Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary
            production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic
            interactions of kelp forest ecosystems.
